        Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary field focused on designing and analyzing structures to withstand seismic activity and minimize earthquake damage. This involves understanding how earthquakes affect buildings, bridges, and other structures through methods like seismic studies, lab testing, and computer simulations. Its goal is to make structures
